TOUR GUIDE

Overview
The purpose of the website is to provide users with a virtual tour guide service. The business name being Tour Guide. The ultimate goal is to provide the user with an itinerary for their holiday. They can view the options in terms of type of holiday, eg. beach, bush or mountain, and then submit an enquiry following which an agent can contact the user to get additional details and plan the user’s holiday.

Features
•	The website in its simplest form will consists of 3 pages.

Header and Footer
•	All pages will have the same basic layout with the same header and footer.
•	The header with the logo and nav bar with Home, Gallery and Enquire menu options.

•	The footer with company name, a link to the enquiry form and links to social media and a link to top of page.
•	For the social media links layout, I used a blend of Coders Coffee House and Love running. I’ve only included links to Facebook, Twitter and Instagram

Mid-section Landing page
•	First off is a title for the page
•	Followed by 3 sections for the 3 destination types I have chosen: beach, bush and mountain. There are many more to grow the site, like adding island, desert holiday types and then having sub-categories that include a choice of skiing, quad-biking, horse riding, surfing, rock climbing, mountain climbing ... the list can literally go on forever. For now, I kept it simple. 
•	Each section will contain an image depicting the destination type to the left and to the right, the heading describing the type of holiday followed by some text to hype up the user on the respective location. If the user is interested, the user may click on the “enquire now!” link provided below the text. The latter will take the user to the enquiry form (same as the Enquire menu option on the nav menu bar in the header).

Enquiry Form
By choosing the Enquire menu option in the header (or a link elsewhere on the home page) an Enquiry Form page opens in a new tab. The user may complete and submit an enquiry form with their contact details, planned travelling dates, choice of holiday type and any additional details or comments to assist the Tour Guide agent in preparing for the "call back".

Gallery Page
At any time, the user may click on the Gallery menu option which will open the Gallery page in a new tab. Here the user may view more images of various holiday destinations.

Future Features
The initial idea was that each tile on the index page would take the user to a new page, opened in a separate tab. In the new page the user can view images that show what the user can expect to enjoy on such a holiday and the different locations. From there the user would be able to expand to further detail on the location, including activities, places of interest and pricing.
