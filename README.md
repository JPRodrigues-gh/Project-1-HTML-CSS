**Introduction**

Hello All,

Welcome to my first project. I have used the Code Institute's template to create the repository for this project. I also used a combination of the Love Running README.md and the CI Readme.md template file as a guide to structure this README.md

I have decided to build a travel web site. 
__________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________

**Overview**
The purpose of the website is to provide users with a virtual tour guide service. The business name being Tour Guide. The unltimate goal is to provide the user with an itinerary for thier holiday.

**Strategy**
The website in its simplest form will contain 5 pages. The first page will be a simple introduction to the site and an index for the user to navigate to the various holiday destination types. All pages will have the same basic lyaout with the same header and footer. The header with the logo and nav bar. The footer with company name, linke to the enquiry form and links to social media. For the social media links I used a blend of Coders Coffee House and Love running.

I have chosen 3 destination types: beach, bush and mountain. There are many more to grow the site, like adding island, desert holiday types and then having sub categories that include a choice of skiing, quad-biking, horse riding, surfing, rock climbing, mountain climbing ... the list can literaly go on forever. So for now, i'll keep it simple.(hopefully not too simple). 

**Scope**
The index page will offer the user three tiles with destination types. Each tile takes the user to a new page, opened in a separate tab. In the destination-type page the user can view images that show what the user can expect to enjoy on such a holiday. (Future enhancement: A more advanced version of these pages to provide the user with links to pages of various destination which are affiliated to **Tour Guide** that will provide more detail on each destination.) 

Once the user has decided on the holiday type, the user may complete and submit an enquiry form with their contact details, planned travelling dates, choice of holiday type and any additional details or comments to assit the Tour Guide agent in preparing for the "call back".

      A form provides fields for the user's contact information, a text input for additional information or comments
