**Introduction**

Hello All,

Welcome to my first project. I have used the Code Institute's template to create the repository for this project. I also used the Love Running README.md file as a guide to structure this README.md

I haven't decided what my first project will be based on. I have a couple of ideas, but I haven't settle on one yet. 

That's all for now.

Regards

JP Rodrigues
